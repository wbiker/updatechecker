<title>Building your own Moose</title>
<link></link>
<description>So you&#x27;ve switched to Moose a long time ago and you&#x27;re quite happy with it, but you slowly notice that there are, well, things you wish it did differently. Fortunately, there&#x27;s the MooseX:: namespace and now you have boilerplate you type at the beginning of every module.use Moose;
use MooseX::StrictConstructor;
use MooseX::HasDefaults::RO;
use My::Moose::Types;
The above incantation says &#x22;die if there are unknown arguments to new(), and attributes should be read-only by default, and throw in my custom-defined Moose types as well&#x22;.But boilerplate is bad. In my quest to remove boilerplate, I&#x27;ve produced Test::Most and other modules, but in this case, there&#x27;s not much to release because many people&#x27;s Moose preferences will be different. Still, it would be much nicer to write use My::Moose; rather than continually repeating the lines above, so here&#x27;s how to do that.</description>

<title>Let&#x27;s make a Perl Nerd Merit Badge</title>
<link></link>
<description>Somehow I ran across Nerd Merit Badges. They have a cool Stackoverflow badge and an octocat badge. I want a [animal redacted pending permission] Perl nerd merit badge to be part of their line up. We can easily make custom badges, so that&#x27;s a good place to start.Pledge to get a Perl Nerd Merit BadgeI&#x27;ve started a Crowdtilt campaign to collect money to make their minimum order and a little extra, even though we don&#x27;t have the design yet (but we all know what it&#x27;s going to be, right? :) I&#x27;ll collect the money, make the order, receive the shipment, and send out the badges. You just need to pledge some money.And, if someone with some design skills can follow their guidelines (and maybe talk to me), we can get that bit going. If you think you have something, send me your design and we&#x27;ll let people vote. Or something. I don&#x27;t know yet. We&#x27;re JFDI right now. :)</description>

<title>YAPC::Asia Tokyo 2013: Fighting Legacy Code</title>
<link></link>
<description>Due to popular demand, I&#x27;m going to post a summary/transcript of my presentation for YAPC::Asia Tokyo 2013, titled &#x22;Fighting Legacy Code&#x22;. It&#x27;s also the presentation that I would&#x27;ve given if I didn&#x27;t cancel my attendance for YAPC::NA Austin 2013. Because I wrote all this in a rush, the language is very terse. Please let me know on twitter (@lestrrat) if somethings don&#x27;t make sense.You could also take a look at my Japanese slides while reading through this. You may get a little more feel for what I&#x27;m writing about. </description>

<title>NET::LDAP Active Directory SID Unpack</title>
<link></link>
<description>I was searching high and low for a way to unpack what NET::LDAP was returning for an objectSID. When dumped, it was just a bunch of line noise garbage. Trying to figure out what format it was in I came across this:Re: Getting Active Directory objectsid value using Net::LDAP - Help!c. church says: Looking on MSN, which describes the SID structure (urL :http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/security/Security/sid_components.asp) it seems to say this: the format of the sid is S-R-S-S... Where the first byte is the revision level of the SID structure, the next 48bits (6 bytes) are the authority that issued the SID and then a variable number of (48bit?) subauthority values, as defined in Winnt.h The Microsoft URL referred to above is dead. (Microsoft has no idea how to keep the antiquated, yet useful, documentation they produce alive, yet they manage to keep Windows XP kickin&#x27; for over a decade. Go figure.)</description>
